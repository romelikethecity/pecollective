# PE Collective Landing Page Formula

Adapted from Harry Dry's Marketing Examples framework. Reference: verum-website/docs/LANDING-PAGE-FORMULA.md

---

## The Problem (January 2026)

GSC data shows 155 impressions/week for "prompt engineering guide" with **0 clicks**. Searchers see a job board title/description and skip it. The landing page copy doesn't match search intent.

**Top keywords by impressions (7-day):**
| Keyword | Impressions | Clicks | Intent |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------|
| prompt engineering guide | 155 | 0 | Educational |
| prompt engineering best practices | 7 | 0 | Educational |
| prompt engineer collective stock ticker | 6 | 0 | Brand |
| the pe collective | 5 | 0 | Brand |
| prompting guide ai | 4 | 0 | Educational |
| prompt guide | 3 | 0 | Educational |
| prompt engineering community | 1 | 0 | Community |
| free ai courses | 1 | 0 | Educational |
| prompt engineering | 1 | 0 | Educational |
| llm prompt engineering news | 1 | 0 | News |

**Takeaway:** ~175 of ~200 weekly impressions are educational intent. The site is being shown but nobody clicks because the SERP snippet screams "job board."

## Above the Fold (Earn Attention)

### 1. Title — Explain the value you provide

Three options (Harry Dry):

**Option A: Explain what you do**
- ONLY works when your product is genuinely unique/differentiated
- The differentiation must be visible IN the title itself
- If you could swap in a competitor's name and the title still works, you're not differentiated enough

**Examples where this works (unique products):**
- "Coffee-Infused Energy Bars" (Quantum — the product itself is unique)
- "Silence embarrassing notifications while screensharing" (Muzzle — unique problem solved)

**PE Collective problem:** "Prompt Engineering Guide, Jobs & Community" describes a category, not a differentiator. Any competitor could use this title. This approach only works if we can name what makes us genuinely different IN the title.

**Option B: Use a hook (VALUE + OBJECTION)**
- Most products aren't unique, so a hook adds oomph
- The formula: identify the VALUE → identify the customer's biggest OBJECTION → combine them into the title

**The Hook Framework:**
| Value | Objection | Value + Hook |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Rank higher on Google | "I suck at SEO" | "You don't have to be an SEO pro to rank higher on Google" |
| Ace the SAT | "I bet it's hard work" | "Ace the SAT with just 10 minutes of studying per day" |
| Erectile dysfunction pills | "I can't ask my doctor" | "Erectile dysfunction pills. Direct to your door." |

The hook addresses why the customer thinks they CAN'T get the value, and removes that barrier in the title.

**PE Collective objections to address:**
- "Most prompt engineering guides are generic AI slop" → hook around real practitioners
- "I don't know where to start" → hook around simplicity/curation
- "I can't find salary data I trust" → hook around real data from real people
- "Prompt engineering resources are scattered everywhere" → hook around one place

**Option C: Own your niche**
- Write with conviction. You're THE destination.
- Example: "The #1 Resource for Prompt Engineers"

**Current PE Collective title:** "Find Your Next AI Career Move" (generic, job-only, doesn't match 80%+ of search intent)

**Recommendation:** Option B (hook). PE Collective isn't unique enough for "explain what you do" unless the differentiation (1,300 practitioners, not content marketers) is IN the title. A hook that addresses why existing guides fail would be strongest.

### 2. Subtitle — Explain how you'll create the value

The subtitle has TWO distinct jobs in one sentence:
1. **Introduce the product** (what it actually IS)
2. **Explain how it creates the value promised in your title** (the mechanism, not just features)

The subtitle must connect directly back to the title's promise. It's not a feature list in a vacuum.

**Harry Dry examples (color-coded by role):**
- **Dormio** — Title: "Your most restful sleep is just a sip away"
  - Subtitle: **"Calming teas"** (product) + **"that help you relax, unwind, and drift into a deep, restorative sleep."** (how it delivers "restful sleep")
- **Privy** — Title: "How small brands sell more online"
  - Subtitle: **"Privy's conversion, email marketing, and text messaging tools"** (product) + **"help you get more customers from your traffic."** (how it delivers "sell more")
- **Everydae** — Title: "Ace the SAT with just 10 minutes of studying a day"
  - Subtitle: **"10-min microlessons"** (product) + **"designed to boost confidence and make SAT strategies easy to remember."** (how it delivers "ace the SAT")

**Pattern:** [Product] + [how it delivers the title's promise]

**Current PE Collective subtitle:** "The job board built by AI professionals, for AI professionals. Real jobs, real salaries, and market intelligence without the recruiter spin."

**Problems:**
1. Says "job board" in the first 3 words. Someone searching "prompt engineering guide" bounces immediately.
2. Doesn't connect back to any title promise (the current title is about "AI career move" but the subtitle talks about being "built by AI professionals")
3. Lists features ("real jobs, real salaries") without tying them to a specific value

**Recommendation:** Subtitle must introduce what PE Collective IS (product), then explain how it delivers whatever the title promises. The two must work as a pair.

### 3. Visual — Let the user visualize it

Show off your product. Get as close to reality as possible.

**DO:**
- Show blog article cards (guides people can read NOW)
- Show job listings (real opportunities)
- Show community stats (proof of activity)

**DON'T:**
- Fancy illustrations
- Stock photos
- Abstract graphics

**Current:** Stat cards (good for social proof, but not a "visual" of the product)

### 4. Social Proof — Make it believable

Social proof above the fold adds instant credibility.

**Current stats:**
- 247 Active AI Jobs
- $185k Median Salary
- 68% Remote Roles
- 1.3k Community Members

**These are good.** Keep them. They work for both job seekers and people exploring the community.

### 5. CTA — Make taking the next step easy

Three CTA types (Harry Dry):

**Option A: Call to value**
- Emphasize "value" over "action"
- "Read the Guide" not "Learn More"
- "Browse AI Jobs" not "Get Started"

**Option B: Objection handle**
- "Join Free — No Spam, Ever"

**Option C: Email capture**
- Newsletter signup directly in the hero

**Current CTAs:** "Browse All Jobs" + "Join the Community"

**Problem:** Both are job/community focused. Someone who searched "prompt engineering guide" has no clear next step.

**Recommendation:** Primary CTA should match top search intent. "Read the Guide" or "Start Learning" alongside "Browse AI Jobs."

## Below the Fold (Earn the Sale)

### 6. Features — Make the value concrete

Show the specific things people can do on the site. For PE Collective, this means sections for:

- **Guides & Articles** (prompt engineering guide, best practices, freelancing)
- **AI Jobs** (featured roles with real salaries)
- **Tools** (Cursor, Copilot reviews)
- **Salary Data** (market intelligence)

**Current page has:** Featured Jobs, Tools Preview, Newsletter CTA, Community CTA

**Missing:** Any mention of guides/articles/blog content. This is the biggest gap.

### 7. More Social Proof — Inspire action

Use community members or readers to bring value to life.

**Current:** Newsletter CTA ("Get Smarter About AI in 3 Minutes")
**Could add:** Testimonial or community quote

### 8. FAQ — Tie up loose ends

Currently missing. Could address:
- "What is prompt engineering?"
- "How do I get started as a prompt engineer?"
- "What do prompt engineers earn?"

These would also help with keyword targeting and FAQ schema for rich snippets.

### 9. 2nd CTA — Repeat your call to action

**Current:** "Join 1,300+ AI Professionals" section. Good.

### 10. Founder's Note — Make yourself memorable

Currently missing. Could add a brief note from Rome that humanizes the site and explains why PE Collective exists.

**Template:**
> "I started PE Collective because [problem you experienced]. [What you built]. [The happy ending for the reader]."
> — Rome, Founder

## Writing Guidelines (Anti-AI Detection)

### DO:
- Use contractions ("we're", "doesn't")
- Vary sentence length dramatically
- Add natural pauses and organic breaks
- Use direct "you" addressing the reader
- Include specific details only insiders know
- Use imperfect transitions ("So," "Look,")

### NEVER:
- Em-dashes (heavily flagged as AI)
- Performative interjections ("That's not a typo")
- Commentary after stats ("Let that sink in")
- Hollow phrases ("cutting-edge", "revolutionary", "leverage")
- Overly parallel structure in lists
- Rhetorical questions with immediate answers
- "Unlock", "Unleash", "Empower", "Supercharge"

### Voice Check:
Read it out loud. If it sounds like a person talking to a colleague, you're on track. If you hear yourself performing casualness, rewrite it.

## SEO Requirements

### Meta Tags
- **Title:** Under 60 characters, include primary keyword ("prompt engineering")
- **Meta description:** 120-160 characters with benefit + implied CTA
- **Canonical URL:** `https://pecollective.com/`

### Structured Data
- Organization schema (homepage)
- FAQ schema (if FAQ section added)
- BreadcrumbList not needed (homepage)

### Internal Linking
- 3-5 internal links minimum
- Link to blog articles, tools, jobs, salaries
- Use descriptive anchor text

## The Ultimate Test

Your landing page is your sales pitch. Examine each element and ask:

> **Would this help me sell if I met the visitor in person?**

If someone walked up and said "I'm looking for a prompt engineering guide," would you say "Here's a job board"? No. You'd say "We've got guides, a community of 1,300+ professionals, and we track AI jobs and salaries too."

The landing page should do the same thing.
