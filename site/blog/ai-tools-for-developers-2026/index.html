        <div class="article-content">
          <p>The AI developer tool landscape changes every few months. What was brand new in early 2025 is either table stakes or abandoned by now. Instead of listing every tool with a landing page, this guide covers the ones developers are actually using in production and why.</p>

<p>I've organized this by category: coding assistants that help you write code, frameworks that help you build AI applications, and vector databases that power search and <a href="/glossary/rag/">retrieval systems</a>. For each tool, you'll get what it does well, where it falls short, and what it costs.</p>

<h2>AI Coding Assistants</h2>

<p>These tools sit in your editor and help you write code faster. The category has matured significantly. The question isn't whether to use one. It's which one fits your workflow.</p>

<h3>Cursor</h3>

<p>Cursor is an AI-first code editor built on top of VS Code. It's not a plugin. It's a full editor that reimagines how AI integrates into your coding workflow.</p>

<p><strong>What it does well:</strong> Cursor's standout feature is its ability to understand your entire codebase, not just the file you're editing. You can ask it questions about your project, and it pulls context from relevant files automatically. The "Composer" feature lets you describe changes in natural language and it edits multiple files at once. For refactoring tasks, this saves hours.</p>

<p><strong>Where it falls short:</strong> It can be sluggish on very large codebases (100K+ lines). The subscription cost adds up if you're using it across a team. And if you're deeply invested in a different editor's plugin ecosystem, the switch has friction.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free tier with limited AI usage. Pro plan at $20/month with 500 fast requests. Business plan at $40/month with higher limits and team features.</p>

<h3>GitHub Copilot</h3>

<p>The original AI coding assistant. Copilot is a plugin that works inside VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, and other editors.</p>

<p><strong>What it does well:</strong> Autocomplete is still best-in-class for line-by-line and function-level suggestions. The integration is mature and stable. Copilot Chat lets you ask questions about your code inline. The new Copilot Workspace feature (for planning and executing multi-file changes) has improved a lot since its early preview.</p>

<p><strong>Where it falls short:</strong> Context awareness lags behind Cursor. Copilot primarily looks at the current file and open tabs, not your full codebase. For complex refactoring or architectural questions, this matters. Test generation quality is inconsistent.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> $10/month for individual. $19/month per user for Business. $39/month per user for Enterprise. Free for verified students and open-source maintainers.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/windsurf/">Windsurf</a></h3>

<p>Windsurf (formerly Codeium) is positioning itself as the Cursor alternative with a different philosophy: AI that flows alongside your coding rather than taking over.</p>

<p><strong>What it does well:</strong> The "Cascade" feature creates an AI workflow that watches what you're doing and proactively suggests next steps. It's less about asking the AI to do things and more about the AI anticipating what you need. The autocomplete is fast and the context understanding is solid. Pricing undercuts competitors significantly.</p>

<p><strong>Where it falls short:</strong> Smaller community and ecosystem than Cursor or Copilot. Some users report that proactive suggestions can be distracting until you tune the settings. Multi-file editing isn't as polished as Cursor's Composer.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free tier is actually useful (not just a trial). Pro at $15/month. Team plans available.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/claude-code/">Claude Code</a></h3>

<p>Anthropic's command-line <a href="/glossary/ai-coding-assistant/">AI coding agent</a>. Unlike the editors above, Claude Code runs in your terminal and operates on your codebase through the command line.</p>

<p><strong>What it does well:</strong> Exceptional at complex, multi-step coding tasks. It reads your codebase, plans changes, edits files, runs tests, and iterates based on results. For tasks like "add authentication to this API" or "refactor this module to use the repository pattern," it can handle the full workflow autonomously. The agentic approach means it catches and fixes its own errors.</p>

<p><strong>Where it falls short:</strong> The terminal-based interface isn't for everyone. There's no inline autocomplete since that's not the use case. Cost can spike on large tasks since it uses Claude API credits. Best suited for substantial tasks rather than quick completions.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Requires a Claude API subscription. Costs vary by usage but expect $50-200/month for active development use.</p>

<h3>Which coding assistant should you use?</h3>

<div class="technique-card">
  <div class="technique-card__title">Quick Decision Guide</div>
  <p class="technique-card__description">
    <strong>Choose Cursor if:</strong> You want the deepest AI integration and don't mind switching editors. Best for full-stack developers working on medium-sized codebases.<br><br>
    <strong>Choose GitHub Copilot if:</strong> You want solid autocomplete without changing your editor setup. Best for developers who want AI assistance without disruption.<br><br>
    <strong>Choose <a href="/tools/windsurf/">Windsurf</a> if:</strong> You want a proactive AI companion at a lower price point. Best for developers who like the flow-state approach.<br><br>
    <strong>Choose <a href="/tools/claude-code/">Claude Code</a> if:</strong> You tackle large, complex tasks and prefer autonomous execution over autocomplete. Best for senior developers and complex refactoring.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>AI Frameworks for Building Applications</h2>

<p>If you're building an application that uses <a href="/glossary/large-language-model/">LLMs</a>, you'll probably use a framework. These handle the plumbing: prompt management, <a href="/glossary/chain-of-thought/">chain orchestration</a>, retrieval, memory, and <a href="/glossary/tool-use/">tool use</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/langchain/">LangChain</a></h3>

<p>The most popular AI framework by GitHub stars and npm downloads. LangChain provides the building blocks for LLM-powered applications.</p>

<p><strong>What it does well:</strong> Massive ecosystem. There's a LangChain integration for basically everything: every vector database, every LLM provider, every document loader you can think of. LangGraph (the agent framework built on top) is powerful for complex workflows. LangSmith provides production monitoring and eval tools.</p>

<p><strong>Where it falls short:</strong> The abstraction layers can feel excessive for simple use cases. If you just need to call an API and process the response, LangChain adds complexity you don't need. The API has changed significantly across versions, making tutorials from 6 months ago unreliable. Debug messages can be cryptic.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Open source (MIT license). LangSmith cloud starts free, paid tiers from $39/month for teams.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/llamaindex/">LlamaIndex</a></h3>

<p>LlamaIndex started as a RAG-focused framework and has expanded into a general-purpose LLM application toolkit. It's the best choice if retrieval is your primary use case.</p>

<p><strong>What it does well:</strong> RAG is where LlamaIndex shines brightest. The document loading, chunking, indexing, and retrieval pipeline is more intuitive than LangChain's. Built-in support for advanced retrieval strategies like hybrid search, re-ranking, and recursive retrieval. The managed service (LlamaCloud) handles document parsing and indexing at scale.</p>

<p><strong>Where it falls short:</strong> Less mature for non-RAG use cases. The agent framework is functional but not as developed as LangGraph. Smaller community means fewer tutorials and examples. Some advanced features require the paid cloud service.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Open source (MIT license). LlamaCloud starts free, paid tiers from $35/month.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/crewai/">CrewAI</a></h3>

<p>CrewAI takes a different approach: instead of building chains, you build teams of <a href="/glossary/ai-agent/">AI agents</a> that collaborate on tasks.</p>

<p><strong>What it does well:</strong> The multi-agent model is intuitive for complex workflows. You define agents with specific roles (researcher, writer, reviewer), give them tools, and let them coordinate. For tasks that naturally decompose into specialized sub-tasks, this pattern is more readable than a chain of prompts. Getting started is fast.</p>

<p><strong>Where it falls short:</strong> Token costs can spiral because agents exchange messages that all consume context. Fine-grained control over agent behavior requires diving into the underlying code. For simple, linear workflows, the multi-agent model is overkill.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Open source (MIT license). Enterprise cloud platform with additional features has custom pricing.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/dspy/">DSPy</a></h3>

<p>DSPy is the contrarian pick. While other frameworks focus on prompt templates, DSPy treats prompts as optimizable programs. You define the logic, and DSPy automatically optimizes the prompts through compilation.</p>

<p><strong>What it does well:</strong> When it works, it produces better prompts than you'd write manually. The programming model (signatures, modules, optimizers) is clean and composable. Evaluation-driven development is built into the workflow. For teams with strong ML backgrounds, the approach clicks fast.</p>

<p><strong>Where it falls short:</strong> Steep learning curve. The mental model is different enough from traditional prompt engineering that it takes real time to internalize. Documentation is improving but still has gaps. The compilation step adds complexity to the development loop.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Open source (MIT license).</p>

<h3>Which framework should you use?</h3>

<div class="technique-card">
  <div class="technique-card__title">Framework Decision Guide</div>
  <p class="technique-card__description">
    <strong><a href="/tools/langchain/">LangChain</a>:</strong> Best default choice. Huge ecosystem, most tutorials, works for almost everything. Start here unless you have a specific reason not to.<br><br>
    <strong><a href="/tools/llamaindex/">LlamaIndex</a>:</strong> Best for RAG-heavy applications. If search and retrieval is your core feature, LlamaIndex will save you time.<br><br>
    <strong><a href="/tools/crewai/">CrewAI</a>:</strong> Best for multi-agent workflows. If your task naturally decomposes into specialized sub-tasks, the agent team model is elegant.<br><br>
    <strong><a href="/tools/dspy/">DSPy</a>:</strong> Best for optimization-minded teams. If you want the framework to improve your prompts automatically and you're comfortable with a steeper learning curve, DSPy is uniquely powerful.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Vector Databases</h2>

<p>If you're building anything with <a href="/glossary/rag/">RAG</a> or <a href="/glossary/semantic-search/">semantic search</a>, you need a <a href="/glossary/vector-database/">vector database</a>. These store <a href="/glossary/embeddings/">embeddings</a> and let you find similar content quickly.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/pinecone/">Pinecone</a></h3>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams that want a managed service with zero infrastructure work. Pinecone handles scaling, replication, and performance tuning automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Fast query performance at scale. Excellent documentation. Hybrid search (combining vector similarity with keyword filtering) works well. The serverless tier makes it affordable to start.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vendor lock-in. No self-hosted option. Costs can surprise you at scale because pricing is based on pod hours and storage, not just queries.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free tier with 100K vectors. Serverless starts at $0.33 per million read units.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/weaviate/">Weaviate</a></h3>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams that want flexibility. Weaviate runs in the cloud (managed) or on your own infrastructure (self-hosted).</p>

<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Built-in vectorization (it can generate embeddings for you, not just store them). GraphQL API is powerful for complex queries. Multi-tenancy support is excellent for SaaS applications. Active open-source community.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Self-hosting requires more DevOps knowledge than you might expect. Resource consumption is higher than some alternatives for small datasets. The GraphQL API has a learning curve if you're not familiar with it.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Open source (self-hosted is free). Managed cloud starts at $25/month for the sandbox tier.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/chroma/">Chroma</a></h3>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Developers who want the simplest possible setup. Chroma can run in-memory with no external dependencies.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Dead simple to get started. Install with pip, three lines of code to create a collection and add documents. Perfect for prototyping and small applications. The API is clean and Pythonic.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Not designed for large-scale production workloads (yet). Limited query filtering compared to Pinecone or Weaviate. The hosted cloud service is newer and less battle-tested.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Open source (Apache 2.0). Hosted cloud in beta.</p>

<h3><a href="/tools/pgvector/">pgvector</a></h3>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams already using PostgreSQL who don't want another database to manage.</p>

<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> It's just a Postgres extension. If you know SQL, you know how to use it. No new infrastructure, no new query language, no new operational burden. Transactional consistency with your other data. Works with every Postgres hosting provider.</p>

<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Query performance falls behind purpose-built vector databases at scale (millions of vectors). No built-in features like automatic embedding generation or hybrid search. You're doing more plumbing yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free (open-source extension). You pay for your Postgres hosting as usual.</p>

<h2>Other Tools Worth Knowing About</h2>

<h3>Prompt management and observability</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>LangSmith:</strong> Traces LLM calls, runs evals, tracks prompt versions. Best if you're already using LangChain</li>
  <li><strong>Weights & Biases Prompts:</strong> Prompt versioning and evaluation for ML teams</li>
  <li><strong>Humanloop:</strong> Prompt management with human feedback loops. Good for teams iterating on AI products with user feedback</li>
</ul>

<h3>Local model tools</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ollama:</strong> Run open-source models locally with one command. Essential for development and testing without API costs</li>
  <li><strong>vLLM:</strong> High-performance model serving. If you're deploying open-source models in production, vLLM gives you the best <a href="/glossary/throughput/">throughput</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Choose Your Stack</h2>

<p>Don't adopt tools for the sake of it. Start with the minimum viable stack and add complexity only when you hit real limitations.</p>

<p><strong>For a simple chatbot or content tool:</strong> An LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google) plus a coding assistant. No framework needed until you outgrow raw API calls.</p>

<p><strong>For a RAG application:</strong> LlamaIndex or LangChain for the pipeline, plus a vector database. Chroma for prototyping, Pinecone or pgvector for production.</p>

<p><strong>For a multi-agent system:</strong> CrewAI or LangGraph for orchestration, plus whatever retrieval and tools your agents need.</p>

<p>The best stack is the one you actually ship with. Don't spend weeks evaluating tools when you could be building. Pick something reasonable, start building, and switch later if you hit real limitations. Most of these tools are modular enough that switching costs are manageable.</p>
