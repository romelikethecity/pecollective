        <div class="article-content">
          <p>Vector databases became the "must-have" infrastructure for AI applications in 2024. Every <a href="/glossary/rag/">RAG</a> tutorial starts with "first, set up your vector database." But here's what most tutorials won't tell you: many AI applications don't need a dedicated vector database at all.</p>

<p>This guide explains what vector databases actually do, compares the major options with real pricing and performance data, and gives you a clear framework for deciding whether you need one.</p>

<h2>What Vector Databases Actually Do</h2>

<h3>The Problem They Solve</h3>

<p>Traditional databases are built for exact matches. You search for a customer ID, a product name, or a date range, and the database returns rows that match precisely. But AI applications need similarity search: "find the documents most similar to this question."</p>

<p>Similarity search works on embeddings: numerical representations of text (or images, or any data) where similar items are close together in high-dimensional space. The sentence "How do I reset my password?" and "I forgot my login credentials" have different words but similar embeddings because they mean similar things.</p>

<p>A <a href="/glossary/vector-database/">vector database</a> stores these embeddings and finds the closest ones to a query vector quickly, even across millions of items. That's the core functionality. Everything else is an optimization on top.</p>

<h3>How Embeddings Work</h3>

<p>An embedding model (like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small or Cohere's embed-v3) converts text into a fixed-length array of numbers (typically 384-1536 dimensions). Two pieces of text with similar meaning produce vectors that are close together when you measure distance between them.</p>

<p>The most common distance metrics are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cosine similarity:</strong> Measures the angle between vectors. Most popular for text similarity. Score ranges from -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical).</li>
  <li><strong>Euclidean distance:</strong> Straight-line distance between points. Works well when vector magnitude matters.</li>
  <li><strong>Dot product:</strong> Computationally fastest. Works well with normalized vectors (which most embedding models produce).</li>
</ul>

<p>For most text-based AI applications, cosine similarity with a standard embedding model works well. Don't overthink the distance metric choice unless you're seeing specific retrieval quality issues.</p>

<h2>The Major Vector Databases Compared</h2>

<h3>Pinecone</h3>

<p>The most popular managed vector database. Fully hosted, no infrastructure to manage.</p>

<div class="technique-card">
  <div class="technique-card__title">Pinecone</div>
  <p class="technique-card__description">
    <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free tier (1 index, 2GB storage). Starter at $70/month. Standard from $231/month. Enterprise custom pricing.<br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> Easiest setup (5 minutes to first query). Excellent documentation. Reliable uptime. Metadata filtering built in.<br>
    <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Vendor lock-in. Gets expensive at scale. Limited query flexibility compared to self-hosted options.<br>
    <strong>Best for:</strong> Teams that want zero infrastructure management. Startups and mid-size companies building RAG applications.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>Weaviate</h3>

<p>Open-source vector database with both self-hosted and managed cloud options.</p>

<div class="technique-card">
  <div class="technique-card__title">Weaviate</div>
  <p class="technique-card__description">
    <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free (self-hosted). Weaviate Cloud: free sandbox, Standard from $25/month for small workloads. Enterprise pricing scales with usage.<br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> Open source (can self-host for free). Built-in hybrid search (vector + keyword). GraphQL API. Supports multiple embedding models natively.<br>
    <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Self-hosting requires DevOps knowledge. Cloud pricing can surprise at scale. More complex setup than Pinecone.<br>
    <strong>Best for:</strong> Teams that want hybrid search or need to self-host for compliance reasons.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>Chroma</h3>

<p>Lightweight, developer-friendly vector database designed for rapid prototyping.</p>

<div class="technique-card">
  <div class="technique-card__title">Chroma</div>
  <p class="technique-card__description">
    <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free and open source. Hosted offering available with free tier.<br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> Simplest API of any vector database (4 main functions). Runs in-process (no server needed for development). Great Python integration. Very fast for small-medium datasets.<br>
    <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Not designed for large-scale production (millions of vectors). Limited enterprise features. Less mature than Pinecone or Weaviate.<br>
    <strong>Best for:</strong> Prototyping, small to medium applications (under 1M vectors), developers who want the simplest possible setup.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>pgvector (PostgreSQL Extension)</h3>

<p>A PostgreSQL extension that adds vector similarity search to your existing Postgres database.</p>

<div class="technique-card">
  <div class="technique-card__title">pgvector</div>
  <p class="technique-card__description">
    <strong>Pricing:</strong> Free (it's an extension for Postgres you already run). Managed Postgres services (Supabase, Neon, RDS) support it at their standard pricing.<br>
    <strong>Strengths:</strong> No new infrastructure. Vectors live alongside your relational data. Full SQL for querying. ACID transactions. You already know Postgres.<br>
    <strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Slower than dedicated vector databases at scale (10M+ vectors). IVFFlat index requires manual tuning. HNSW index is better but uses more memory.<br>
    <strong>Best for:</strong> Teams already using Postgres. Applications under 5M vectors. Situations where you need vectors + relational data in the same query.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Performance Comparison</h2>

<p>Here are realistic numbers for a common use case: 1M document chunks, 1536-dimension embeddings, returning top 10 results.</p>

<div class="technique-card">
  <div class="technique-card__title">Query Latency (p95, 1M vectors)</div>
  <p class="technique-card__description">
    <strong>Pinecone:</strong> 15-30ms<br>
    <strong>Weaviate (cloud):</strong> 20-50ms<br>
    <strong>Chroma (in-process):</strong> 10-25ms<br>
    <strong>pgvector (HNSW index):</strong> 30-80ms<br><br>
    All of these are fast enough for production RAG applications where the LLM generation step takes 500-3000ms. The vector search latency is rarely your bottleneck.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>When You Need a Dedicated Vector Database</h2>

<p>You actually need a dedicated vector database when:</p>

<h3>You have more than 5 million vectors</h3>
<p>At this scale, pgvector performance degrades noticeably, and dedicated vector databases maintain consistent latency through purpose-built indexing. If your document corpus is large (millions of pages), a dedicated solution makes sense.</p>

<h3>You need sub-10ms query latency</h3>
<p>Real-time applications like autocomplete or live recommendations need the fastest possible retrieval. Dedicated vector databases with in-memory indexing deliver consistent single-digit millisecond latency that pgvector can't match.</p>

<h3>You're doing heavy vector operations</h3>
<p>If your workload is primarily vector similarity search with high query volume (thousands of queries per second), a purpose-built database handles the load more efficiently. Postgres is general-purpose, which means it's adequate at vector operations but not optimal.</p>

<h2>When You Don't Need One</h2>

<p>This is the section most vector database marketing materials skip. You probably don't need a dedicated vector database when:</p>

<h3>Your corpus is under 100K documents</h3>
<p>For small to medium document sets, pgvector works perfectly well. Query latency at 100K vectors is under 20ms with a properly configured HNSW index. You avoid adding a new piece of infrastructure to your stack, which means less to monitor, maintain, and pay for.</p>

<h3>You already use Postgres</h3>
<p>If your application already runs on Postgres (and most web applications do), pgvector keeps everything in one database. Your vectors join with your relational data in a single query. You don't need a separate data pipeline to sync between systems. For most startups and early-stage products, this simplicity is worth more than the performance gains of a dedicated solution.</p>

<h3>You're prototyping</h3>
<p>During prototyping and early development, use Chroma (in-process, zero setup) or pgvector (if you already have Postgres). Don't add infrastructure complexity before you've validated that your RAG approach works. You can migrate to a dedicated vector database later if you need the scale.</p>

<h3>Your retrieval quality issues aren't about the database</h3>
<p>This is the most common mistake. Teams switch vector databases hoping to improve RAG quality. But poor retrieval quality is almost always a chunking problem, an embedding model problem, or a query formulation problem. The database just stores and retrieves vectors. Switching from pgvector to Pinecone won't fix a bad chunking strategy.</p>

<h2>Migration Considerations</h2>

<p>Starting with pgvector and migrating later is a valid strategy. Here's what the migration involves:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Re-embed your documents:</strong> You might want to use a different embedding model anyway. Budget a few dollars for the embedding API calls.</li>
  <li><strong>Update your retrieval code:</strong> Swap the query logic from SQL to the new database's SDK. Typically 50-200 lines of code.</li>
  <li><strong>Set up the new infrastructure:</strong> Managed services (Pinecone, Weaviate Cloud) take 30 minutes. Self-hosted takes longer.</li>
  <li><strong>Test retrieval quality:</strong> Ensure results are equivalent. Run your eval suite against both systems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Total migration time: 1-3 days for a competent engineer. It's not a major undertaking, which is why starting simple and scaling up is usually the right call.</p>

<h2>Practical Recommendations</h2>

<div class="technique-card">
  <div class="technique-card__title">Decision Guide</div>
  <p class="technique-card__description">
    <strong>Prototyping:</strong> Chroma (zero setup, runs in your Python process)<br>
    <strong>Production, under 5M vectors, already on Postgres:</strong> pgvector<br>
    <strong>Production, under 5M vectors, no existing database preference:</strong> Pinecone (managed) or Weaviate Cloud<br>
    <strong>Production, over 5M vectors:</strong> Pinecone or Weaviate<br>
    <strong>On-premises / compliance requirements:</strong> Weaviate (self-hosted) or pgvector<br>
    <strong>Need hybrid search (keyword + vector):</strong> Weaviate
  </p>
</div>

<p>The best vector database is the one that fits your current needs without adding unnecessary complexity. Start simple. Scale when you have data showing you need to.</p>
